\section{Introduction}

Although recent advances in neuroimagining techniques (particularly radio-nuclear and radiological scanning methods) \citep{Schomer2010} have diminished the prospects of the traditional Electroencephalography (EEG), the advent and development of digitized devices has pressed for a revamping of this hundred years old technology.  Their versatility, ease of use, temporal resolution, ease of development and fabrication, and its proliferation as consumer devices, are pushing EEG to become the de-facto non invasive portable or ambulatory method to access and harness brain information~\cite{DeVos2014}.

A key contribution to this expansion has been the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)~\citep{WolpawJonathanR2012} which is the pursuit of the development of a new channel of communication particularly aimed to persons affected by neurodegenerative diseases.

One noteworthy aspect of this novel communication channel is the ability to transmit information from the Central Nervous System (CNS) to a computer device and from there use that information to control a wheelchair~\citep{Carlson2013}, as input to a speller application~\citep{Guger2009a}, in a Virtual Reality environment~\citep{Lotte2013} or as aiding tool in a rehabilitation procedure~\citep{Jure2016}.  The holly grail of BCI is to implement a new complete and alternative pathway to restore lost locomotion~\citep{WolpawJonathanR2012}.

EEG signals are remarkably complex and have been characterized as a multichannel non-stationary stochastic process.  Additionally, they have high variability between different subjects and even between different moments for the same subject, requiring adaptive and co-adaptive calibration and learning procedures \citep{Clerc}.  Hence, this imposes an outstanding challenge that is necessary to overcome in order to extract information from raw EEG signals.

Moreover, EEG markers~\citep{Clerc} that can be used to volitionally transmit information are limited, and each one of them has a particular combination of appropriate methods to decode them. Inevitably, it is necessary to implement  distinct and specialized algorithmic methods, to filter the signal, enhance its Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and try to determine some meaning out of it.  

%Patients suffering from ALS their brain signals do suffer slow and deteriorating changes that may lead to different EEG patterns alterations \citep{Nijboer2009,Riener2014}.

%Besides novel applications of BCI, the goal of the entire discipline is to provide communication assistance to people affected by neuro-degenerative diseases.  It is understood that for people suffering from ALS, even though this pathology do not harm the CNS, their brain signals do suffer slow and deteriorating changes that may lead to different EEG patterns alterations \citep{Nijboer2009,Riener2014}.

BCI has gained mainstream public awareness with worldwide challenge competitions like Cybathlon~\citep{Riener2014} and even been broadcasted during the inauguration ceremony of the 2014 Soccer World Cup.  New developments have overcome the out-of-the-lab high-bar and they are starting to be used in real world environments~\citep{Huggins2016}.  However, they still lack the necessary robustness, and its performance is well behind any other method of human computer interaction, including any kind of detection of residual muscular movement~\citep{Clerc}.

%JG Muy desordenada la intro, escribir un poco mejor
Several works have explored the idea of exploiting the signal waveform to analyze the EEG signal.  In~\citep{Alvarado-Gonzalez2016,Yamaguchi2009} an approach based on Slope Chain Code is presented, as well as the seminal work of Bondt-Pompe Permutation Entropy~\citep{Berger2017}.%JG Y también qué?

%In~\citep{Alvarado-Gonzalez2016,Yamaguchi2009} an approach based on the morphological analysis of the shape of the EEG is presented. In this work the authors use slop chain code. 

In the article~\citep{Ramele2016},  the authors introduce a method for classification of rhythmic EEG events like Visual Occipital Alpha Waves  and Motor Imagery rolandic central $\mu$ rhythms using the histogram of gradient orientations of signal plots.  Inspired in that work, we proposed a novel application of the developed method to classify and describe transient events, particularly the P300 Event Related Potential.  
The proposed approach is based on the morphological analysis of the shape of the EEG signal, but using histogram descriptors. The method is built by mimicking what traditionally electroencephalographers have been performing for almost a century: visually inspecting raw signal plots, as it is described in~\citep{Hartman2005}.

This paper reports a method to, (1) classify P300 signals based on the identification of their structure in the shape domain using histograms of gradient orientations extracted from the image of signal plots, and (2) describe the way in which this classification can be used to implement an offline P300-based BCI Speller application using two public datasets. Its validity is verified by processing offline data for ALS patients and for healthy subjects. 

This article unfolds as follows: in Section \ref{Feature} the Feature Extraction based on Histogram of Gradient Orientations of the Signal Plot method is explained. Section~\ref{Pipeline} describe the processing pipeline.  Section \ref{Plot}  clarifies how the image of the signal plot is constructed whereas Section \ref{SIFT}  describes in detail the feature extraction procedure.  Section \ref{Classification}  presents the classification algorithm based on Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN)~\citep{Boiman2008} and the final Section shows results and discussion where we expose our remarks, conclusions and future work.
%This kind of EEG events are described in~\citep{Hartman2005} and~\citep{Ben-Simon2013}.
\section{Materials and Methods}

The P300~\citep{Farwell1988,Knuth2006} is a positive deflection of the EEG signal which occurs around $300$ ms after the onset of a rare and deviant stimulus that the subject is expected to attend.  It is produced under the oddball paradigm~\cite{WolpawJonathanR2012} and it is consistent across different subjects. It has a lower amplitude  ($\pm 5 \mu V $) compared to basal EEG activity, reaching a SNR of around $-15$ db estimated based on the amplitude of the P300 response signal divided by the standard deviation of the background EEG activity~\citep{Hu2010}.  This signal can be used to implement a speller application by means of a Speller Matrix~\citep{Farwell1988}. Fig.~\ref{fig:p300matrix} shows an example of the Speller Matrix used in the OpenVibe Open Source software~\citep{Renard2010}, where the flashes of rows and columns provide the deviant stimulus required to elicit this physiological response.   Each time a row or a column that contains the desired letter flashes, the corresponding synchronized EEG signal should also contain the P300 signature and by detecting it, the selected letter can be identified.

\label{fig:p300matrix}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature Extraction based on Histogram of Gradient Orientations of the Signal Plot} \label{Feature}

%The underlying idea of this method is to generate templates for the signal \citep{Ramele2016}, based on the image plot.  Hence, the first step is the processing of the EEG signal.
In this section, the signal preprocessing, the method for generating images from signal plots, the feature extraction procedure and the speller matrix identification are described. 

\subsubsection{Preprocessing Pipeline} \label{Pipeline}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Signal Enhancement}: The preprocessing stage consists of the enhancement of the SNR of the P300 pattern above the level of basal EEG. The processing pipeline starts by applying a notch filter to the raw signal, a 
$4$th degree $10$ Hz lowpass Butterworth filter and finally a decimation with a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter of order $30$ from the original sampling frequency down to $16$ Hz \citep{Krusienski2006}.
\item \textbf{Artefact Removal}: The EEG signal matrix is processed on a channel by channel basis.   For every 12 flashing stimuli, i.e. one complete sequence of intensification of each of the $6$ rows plus the $6$ columns, a basic artefact elimination procedure is implemented by removing the entire sequence when any signal deviates above/bellow $ \pm 70 \mu V $.
\item \textbf{Segmentation}: For each of the $12$ stimuli,  a window of $1$ second of the multichannel signal is extracted, starting from the stimulus onset, corresponding to each row/column intensification.  Two of these segments should contain the P300 ERP signature time-locked to the flashing stimulus, one for the row, and one for the column.
\item \textbf{Signal Averaging}:  The P300 ERP is deeply buried under background EEG so the traditional approach to identify it is by point-to-point averaging the time-locked stacked signal segments.  Hence the values which are not related to, and not time-locked to the onset of the stimulus are canceled out \citep{Liang2008}. 
\end{itemize}

This last step determines the operation of any P300 Speller.  In order to obtain an improved signal in terms of its SNR, repetitions of the sequence of row/column intensification are necessary.  And, at the same time, as long as more repetitions are needed, the ability to transfer information faster is diminished, so there is a trade-off that must be acutely determined.

\subsubsection{Signal Plotting} \label{Plot}

Averaged signal segments are scaled and standardized by 

\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}(t,c) = \left \lfloor{ \gamma \cdot \frac{( x(t,c) - \bar{x}(c)  )}{ \sigma(c) } }\right \rfloor, t \in \{0, 1, \dots, F_s\},c \in \{1,2,\dots,8\}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\gamma > 0$ is an input parameter of the algorithm and  it is related with the image scale. On the other hand, $ x(t,c) $ is the point-to-point averaged EEG matrix for time $t$ and for channel $c$. The parameter $F_s$ is the sampling frequency. Lastly, $\bar{x}(c)$ and $ \sigma (c) $ are the mean and standard deviation of $x$.

Consequently, the image is constructed by placing the sample points according to

\begin{equation}
I(z_1,z_2) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
255 & \text{if} \,  z_1 = \gamma \cdot t; z_2 = \tilde{x}(t,c) + z(c) \\
0   & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.
\label{eq:images}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $ (z_1,z_2) \in \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}$ iterate over the width (based on the length of the signal segment) and height (based on the peak-to-peak amplitude) of the newly created image,  $t \in \{0, 1, \dots, F_s\}$ and $c \in \{1,2,\dots,8\}$.  The function $z(c)$, $c \in \{1,2,\dots,8\}$ is the location on the image where the signal's zero value has to be located in order to fit the entire signal within the image:

\begin{equation}
z(c) = \left \lfloor{ \frac{\max \tilde{x}(t,c)  - \min \tilde{x}(t,c) }{2} }\right \rfloor -   \left \lfloor{ \frac{\max \tilde{x}(t,c)  + \min \tilde{x}(t,c)}{ 2} }\right \rfloor
\label{eq:zerolevel}
\end{equation}
  
In order to complete the plot from the pixels, the Bresenham \citep{Bresenham1965,Ramele2016} algorithm is used to interpolate straight lines between each pair of  consecutive pixels.


\subsubsection{Feature Extraction: Histogram of Gradient Orientations}
\label{SIFT}

%is calculated on local image patches centered on sample points \citep{Vedaldi2010}.

On the generated image $I$, a keypoint $\mathbf{kp}$ is placed on a pixel $(x_{kp}, y_{kp})$ over the image plot and a window around the keypoint is considered. A local image patch of size $S_p \times S_p$ pixels is constructed by dividing the window in $16$ blocks of size $3s$ each one,  where $s$ is the scale of the local patch and it is an input parameter of the algorithm. It is arranged in a $4 \times 4$ grid and the pixel $ \mathbf{kp}$ is the patch center, then $S_p = 4.3s $ pixels. 

A local representation of the shape of the signal within the patch can be described by obtaining the gradient orientations on each of the $16$ blocks and creating a histogram of gradients.  This technique is based on Lowe's SIFT~\citep{Lowe2004} method, and it is biomimetically inspired in how the visual cortex detects shapes by analyzing orientations.   In order to calculate the histogram, the interval $[0-360]$ of possible angles is divided in $8$ bins, each one at $45$ degrees.

 For each spacial bin $ i,j = \{1,2,3,4\} $, corresponding to the indexes of each block $B_{i,j}$,  the orientations are accumulated in a  $3$-dimensional histogram $h$ through the following equation: 
 

\begin{equation}
 h(\theta,i,j) = 3s \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in B_{i,j}} w_\mathrm{ang}(\angle J(\mathbf{x}) - \theta)\, w_{ij}\left(\frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{kp}}{3 s}\right)\, |J(\mathbf{x})|
\label{eq:histogram}
\end{equation}

\noindent  where $\mathbf{x}$ is a pixel from  the $i,j$-block $B_{i,j}$, $ i,j \in \{1,2,3,4\} $, $ \theta \in \{0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315\} $,  $ |J(\mathbf{x})| $ is the norm of the gradient vector in the pixel $\mathbf{x}$ and it is computed using finite differences, $\angle J(\mathbf{x}) $ is the angle of the gradient vector,  $\theta$ is the angle bin,   and $ w_\mathrm{ang}(\cdot) $  and $ w_{ij}(\cdot) $ are linear interpolation functions used by Lowe and Vedaldi et al. in~\citep{Lowe2004,Vedaldi2010}.  Lastly, the fixed value of $ 3 $ is a magnification factor which corresponds to the number of pixels per each block when $s = 1$.  As the patch has  $16$ blocks and  $8$ bin angles are considered, a descriptor of $128$ dimension is obtained. It can be observed that in each step, the histogram is computed by multiplying by $ |J(\mathbf{x})| $, so the method considers both, the magnitude and the orientation of the gradient vector. 


Fig.~\ref{fig:sampledescriptor} shows an example of a patch and a scheme of the histogram computation. Fig.~\ref{patch} is a plot of the signal and the patch centered in the keypoint. In Fig.~\ref{histogrambines} the possible orientations on each patch are illustrated. They form the corresponding $\mathbf{kp}$-descriptor of $128$ coordinates. The first two blocks are shown.  Following this procedure for every assigned keypoint, we obtain $N_{kp}$ descriptors.

\subsubsection{Speller Matrix letter Identification}
\label{Classification}

%The following step is classify the descriptors $\{d_{kp}, kp =1,\dots, 12\}$ in order to determine the correct row and column of the chosen letter on the Speller Matrix.   The classification is carried out by using a discriminative semi-supervised classification method, based on the Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN)~\citep{Boiman2008}.

The aim is to identify the selected letter from the matrix. Previously, during training phase, two descriptors are extracted from averaged signal segments which correspond to the letter where the user was supposed to be focusing onto.  These descriptors are the P300 templates which are grouped in a template set called $ T $.  Segments corresponding to rows are labeled 1-6, whereas those corresponding to columns are labeled 7-12.  The process has the following steps:


\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{paso1}Highlight randomly the rows and columns from the matrix.  There is one row and one column that should match the letter selected by the subject. For each illuminated row or column, an image is obtained.
\item  \label{paso2} Repeat step~\ref{paso1} $k_a$ times, obtaining the single trial segments $S_1(t,c),\dots,S_{k_a}(t,c)$, where the variables $t \in \{0, 1, \dots, F_s\}$ and $c \in \{1,2,\dots,8\}$ correspond to time and channel, respectively. The parameter $k_a$ is the number of repetitions and it is an input parameter of the algorithm.
\item \label{paso3} Compute  
\begin{equation}
x(t,c)= \frac{1}{k_a}\sum_{i=1}^{k_a}S_i(t,c), t \in \{0, 1, \dots, F_s\}, c \in \{1,\dots,8\}
\label{averaging}
\end{equation}  
for each row and column. 

\item \label{paso4}Plot the signal $x(t,c)$,  $t \in \{0, 1, \dots, F_s\}$, $c \in \{1,\dots,8\}$,  according Section~\ref{Plot}. 

\item Repeat steps~\ref{paso2}, \ref{paso3} and~\ref{paso4} in order to generate the images $I^{row}_1, \dots, I^{row}_6$ and $I^{col}_7,\dots,I^{col}_{12}$ for rows and columns, respectively. 

\item Obtain the descriptors $ d^{row}_1, \dots,  d^{row}_6 $  and  $ d^{col}_7, \dots,  d^{col}_{12} $ for rows and columns, respectively from $I^{row}_1, \dots, I^{row}_6$ and $I^{col}_7,\dots,I^{col}_{12}$  in accordance to the method described in Section~\ref{SIFT}. 

\item Match to the Template $T$ by computing  

\begin{equation}
\hat{row} = \arg \min_{u \in \{1,\dots,6\}} \sum_{q \in NN_T(d^{row}_u)}^{} \left\lVert q -  d^{row}_u \right\rVert ^2
\label{eq:multiclassificationrow}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\hat{col} = \arg \min_{u \in \{7,\dots,12\}} \sum_{q \in NN_T(d^{col}_u)}^{} \left\lVert q -  d^{col}_u \right\rVert ^2
\label{eq:multiclassificationcol}
\end{equation}

where $NN_T(d^l_u), \;l\in\{row,{col}\}$ is the set of the $k$ nearest neighbors to $d^l_u, \;l\in\{row,{col}\}$ and $q$ is a template descriptor that belongs to $NN_T(d^l_u), \;l\in\{row,{col}\}$.  

% By reversing the roles of the query and the class in equations \ref{eq:multiclassificationrow} and \ref{eq:multiclassificationcol}, it is only necessary to obtain the template set $ T $ with the learned descriptors representative of the P300 ERP, hence avoiding the problem of unbalanced classes. 
%The first step consists in extracting labeled \textit{hit} descriptors from the training set which are thus grouped together in a KD-tree \citep{Vedaldi2010} template set $ T $.  On decoding stage, 12 new images from the signal segments are generated, and their descriptors extracted.  The 12 descriptors are divided in rows and columns.  For each one of the 6 query descriptors $ q $ for row/column, its $ k $ nearest neighbours in the template set $T$, $ NN_T^k(q) $ (acquired during the training phase)  are obtained and the distance between each one of them, $ x_i $, and the query descriptor $ q $ is summarized.  The query descriptor $ q $ that minimizes this summation is the one that is chosen, first among the 6 rows, and then among the remaining 6 columns.  By performing this procedure, the correct letter can be identified by matching the row $ r $ and column $ c $ from the P300 speller matrix.   

\end{enumerate}
By computing the aforementioned equations, the letter of the matrix can be determined from the intersection of the row $ \hat{row} $ and column $ \hat{col} $. 
Figure~\ref{fig:classification} shows a schema of this process. 
\begin{figure}[htp]

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{classificationgraph.pdf}
\caption{Single trial segments $S_i$ are averaged for the 6 rows and 6 columns. From the averaged signal, the image of the signal plot is generated and each descriptor is computed.  By comparing each descriptor against the set of templates, the P300 ERP can be detected, and finally the desired letter from the matrix can be inferred.}

%In the case of the P300 response, the oddball paradigm requires that one of the stimuli be infrequent. Hence this forces the data to be unbalanced~\citep{Tibon2015}.  At the same time, the NBNN method suffers from biased classification on unbalanced classes~\citep{Fornoni2014}. %Para solucionar este problema, 


\subsection{Experimental Protocol} \label{Protocol}

To verify the validity of the proposed framework and method, the public dataset 008-2014~\citep{Riccio2013} published on the BNCI-Horizon website~\citep{Brunner2014} by  IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia, is used. Additionally, an own dataset with  the same experimental conditions is generated. Both of them are utilized to perform an offline BCI Simulation to decode the spelled words from the provided signals. 

The algorithm is implemented using  VLFeat~\citep{Vedaldi2010} Computer Vision libraries on MATLAB V2014a (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). 

In the following sections the characteristics of the datasets and parameters of the identification algorithm are described. 

\subsubsection{P300 ALS Public Dataset} \label{ALSDataset}

The experimental protocol used to generate this dataset is explained in~\citep{Riccio2013} but can be summarized as follows:  8 subjects with confirmed diagnoses but on different stages of ALS disease, were recruited and accepted to perform the experiments. The P300 detection task designed for this experiment consisted of spelling 7 words of 5 letters each, using the traditional P300 Speller Matrix~\citep{Farwell1988}. The flashing of rows and columns provide the deviant stimulus required to elicit this physiological response.  The first 3 words are used for training and the remaining 4 words, for testing with visual feedback.  A trial, as defined by the BCI2000 platform~\citep{Schalk2004}, is every attempt to select a letter from the speller. It is composed of signal segments corresponding to $k_a =10$ repetitions of flashes of 6 rows and $k_a =10$ repetitions of flashes of 6 columns of the matrix, yielding 120 repetitions.  Flashing of a row or a column is performed for 0.125 s, following by a resting period (i.e. Inter-stimulus interval) of the same length.  After 120 repetitions an inter-trial pause is included before resuming with the following letter.

The recorded dataset was sampled at 256 Hz and it consisted of scalp EEG matrix for electrode channels Fz,Cz,Pz,Oz,P3,P4,PO7 and PO8, identified according to the 10-20 International System,  for each one of the 8 subjects.   The recording device was a research-oriented digital EEG device (g.Mobilab, g.Tec, Austria) and the data acquisition and stimuli delivery were handled by the BCI2000 open source software~\citep{Schalk2004}.

In order to asses and verify the identification of the P300 response, subjects are instructed to perform a copy-spelling task. They have to fix their attention to successive letters for copying a previously determined set of words, in contrast to a free-running operation of the speller where each user decides on its own what letter to choose.

\subsubsection{P300 for healthy subjects}

We replicate the same experiment on healthy subjects using a wireless digital EEG device (g.Nautilus, g.Tec, Austria).  The experimental conditions are the same as those used for the previous dataset, as detailed in section~\ref{ALSDataset}.

Participants are recruited voluntarily and the experiment is conducted anonymously in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki published by the World Health Organization.  No monetary compensation is handed out and all participants agree and sign a written informed consent.  All healthy subjects have normal or corrected-to normal vision and no history of neurological disorders. The experiment is performed with 20 subjects, 17 males, 3 females, average age 26.85 years, standard deviation  8.8 years, range 19-50 years.

EEG data is collected in a single recording session. Participants are seated in a comfortable chair, with their vision aligned to a computer screen located one meter in front of them.  The handling and processing of the data and stimulations is handled by the OpenVibe platform~\citep{Renard2010}. 

Gel-based active electrodes (g.LADYbird, g.Tec, Austria) are used on the same locations Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, P4, PO7, PO8 and Oz.  Reference is set to the right ear lobe and ground is preset as the AFz position.   Sampling frequency is slightly different, and is set to 250 Hz, which is the closest possible to the one used with the other dataset.


%EEG data were recorded from the same 8 electrodes positions (C3, Cz, C4, CPz, P3, Pz, P4, POz) with all the systems. The reference positions were placed at the right ear. The ground positions was placed at the left ear, except with the g.Nautilus system (placed at AFz, because this could not be changed). Sampling rate was set at 250 Hz, the closest possible to predefined g.Mobilab sampling rate (256 Hz). Data were acquired notch filtered at 50 Hz and passband filtered between 2 Hz and 30 Hz. The filtering was performed via the proprietary Simulink HighSpeed Online Processing block modules for g.MOBIlab and g.Nautilus systems, and via MATLAB code for the Xpress system. Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the acquisition settings for each system.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

% Antes estaba esto aca

% The P300 event latency and amplitude vary greatly between subjects, 

% lo saque porque confunde, ya que despues de todo, dejamos todo fijo, e ignoramos completamente el hecho de que varie.

%Parameters are selected according to the experimental protocol. 
The patch size is $S_P = 3s.4 \times 3s.4$ pixels, where $s$ is the scale of the local patch and it is an input parameter of the algorithm. The P300 event can have a span of $400$ ms and its amplitude can reach $ 10 \mu V $.  Hence it is necessary to utilize a size patch $S_P$ that could capture an entire transient event. With this purpose in consideration, the $s$ value election is essential.
%necesitamos definir el valor de s en función de los parámetros de la señal, de modo tal que el parche cubra el evento completo.  
We propose the equations~\ref{eq:mapping2} and~\ref{eq:mapping1} to compute the scale value in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. 
\begin{equation}
s_x = \frac{\lambda \cdot Fs}{4 \cdot 3} \cdot \gamma
\label{eq:mapping2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
s_y= \frac{\Delta \mu V}{4 \cdot 3} \cdot \gamma 
\label{eq:mapping1}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $ \lambda $ is the length in seconds covered by the patch, $ Fs $ is the sample frequency of the EEG signal (downsampled to 16 Hz) and  $\Delta  \mu V $ corresponds to the amplitude in microvolts that can be covered by the height of the patch. The geometric structure of the patch forces a squared configuration, then we discerned that by using $ s =s_x =s_y = 3 $ and $ \gamma = 4 $  the local patch and the descriptor can identify events of 9 $ \mu V $ of amplitude, with a span of $ \lambda = 0.56$ seconds.  This also provides that $ 1 $ pixel represents $ \frac{1}{\gamma}= \frac{1}{4} \mu V $ on the vertical direction and $\frac{1}{F_s.\gamma}=\frac{1}{64}$ seconds on the horizontal direction. Finally, descriptors  $\mathbf{kp}$  are located at $ (x_{kp}, y_{kp} )= ( 0.55 Fs.\gamma, z(c) )= (35,  z(c)) $ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:zerolevel}).   In this way the whole transient event is captured. 
Figure~\ref{fig:sampledescriptor2} shows a patch of a signal plot covering the complete amplitude (vertical direction) and the complete span of the signal event (horizontal direction). 

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{patchgeometry.pdf}
\caption{The scale of local patch is selected in order to capture the whole transient event.  The size of the patch is $S_p \times S_p$ pixels. The vertical size consists of $4$ blocks $B_{i,j}$  of size $3 s_y$ pixels which is long enough as to contain the signal $\Delta  \mu V $, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the transient event. The horizontal size on the other hand, includes $4$ blocks  of $3 s_x$ and cover the entire duration in seconds of the transient signal event, $ \lambda $.   }

%In Figure \ref{fig:subjectaveraged} the grand average (point-to-point) for all the subjects using the information from all the segments can be shown.  The P300 characteristic curve can be seen particularly in subjects 2, and 6 and in a lesser extend in the remaining subjects. In order to correctly decode the selected letter from each trial, particular care was observed to avoid unbalanced number of epochs  (i.e. an unequal number of epochs on each condition), because that may introduce bias in the classification procedure (the variance of averaged signals is inversely proportional to the number of samples and the procedure would be discriminating signals with different variances).

%RR: esto corresponde al punto 4.1 que dijo el revisor y tiene que ver con proveer informacion del canal en el que la clasificacion dio mejor.

The P300 wave which was traditionally considered as one component, consists of two overlapping components the P3a and P3b, the former with frontocentral distribution while the later stronger on centroparietal region~\citep{Polich2007}. Although the traditional approach is to expect to find a stronger response on the central channel Cz~\citep{Riccio2013}, Wolpaw et al. shows that the response may also arise in occipital channels as well.  The authors~\citep{Riccio2013} that analyzed the public dataset concluded that Cz was the best performing channel, more representative of the difference in amplitudes. However, in our approach, occipital channels,  PO8 and PO7 showed higher performances~\citep{Huggins2016,Jure2016}.

%JG ITR y BTR nunca fueron definidos
The Information Transfer Rate (ITR), or Bit Transfer Rate (BTR), in the case of reactive BCIs~\citep{WolpawJonathanR2012}  depends on the amount of signal averaging required to transmit a valid and robust selection.  Fig.~\ref{fig:performance} shows the performance curves. It can be observed that the percentage of correctly identified letters depends on the number of repetitions that are used to obtain the averaged signal.
For both datasets, the experimental protocol uses a very short ISI which has the potential to increase the ITR but at the same time it is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the P300 response (i.e. harder to detect).  As an unexpected consequence, $15$ out of $20$ subject reported high ocular tiredness by using this configuration.

We find that only by using the visual aspect of the P300 signal plot,  for some subjects it was not possible to find templates that could allow the classification to reach a higher level.  Moreover, as can be seen in the figure, as repetitions tend to 1, which will correspond to single trial letter identification, the performance suffers greatly as the signal plot is  too complex to be used as template and the method is completely unable to find good matches  

We hypothesize that as subjects may have different latencies, amplitudes and width of the P300 signal \citep{Riccio2013}, it may also be the case that the shape of the generated ERP may vary greatly in an intra-subject manner, thus the pattern could not be well generalized and a higher performance could not be reached (Fig.  \ref{fig:p300templates}).  It is known (REFERENCE) that the point-to-point averaging suffers from inter-trial variability (REFERENCIA A ESE PAPER Con ese nombre) due to latencies shifts.  We tested a naive approach to verify if the morphological shape of the P300 can be stabilized by applying different shifts and we verified that there is a better performance when a correct resynchronization is applied.  We also applied DTW but couldn't found a substantial improvement.  Amplitude width and latency are generally affected by habituation, fatigue or level of attention and may lead to null signals.

Considering the amplitude variation of the P300 and its components, we proposed a conservative approach by standardizing the signal (which can have both effects, of reducing noise that were not reduced by the averaging procedure but at the same time it can reduce the amplitude of a significant p300 component).   The standardization also provides another benefit which is sometimes neglected as unimportant.  The variance of the averaged signal depends on the number of signals averaged.  As this method analyze the shape of the signal in the plot, which is  affected by the variance, the method is not be able to discriminate solely based on the underlying cognitive event, it is confused by the number of signals that are used to calculate the averaged signal.

The SIFT method is invariant to the scale, but in order to allow our method to be also invariant to the amplitude of the signal we had to modify the geometry of the descriptor to remove the squared constrain.

Figure~\ref{fig:p300templates} shows the P300 templates patches for subjects 8 and 3 from the public dataset. It can be observed that in coincidence with the performance results, the P300 signature is more clear and consistent for subject 8 (Fig.~\ref{subject8})  while for subject 3 (Fig.~\ref{subject3}) the characteristic pattern is more difficult to perceive.

In Table~\ref{tab:resultsowndataset} results obtained for the 8 healthy subjects is shown.   It shows the results obtained by the present method as described in previous sections.  We used an additional subject as control as he was instructed to count only the letters and to stare at the screen but  neglecting row/column flashing, which achieved zero performance.  We also validated the procedure by visualizing clearly the SSVEP generated by the 4 Hz flashing of lights.

The method beneficial aspect is that its single channel approach and also the most important part is that the method allows close collaboration because templates can be selected by visually inspecting them.

\section{Conclusion}

A method to characterize and classify EEG signals where their characterization is transient in time-space, like the P300 ERP, has been presented.   

%Databases of descriptors.  Flexibility of the descriptor in terms of configuration and size (reference variants of SIFT on lower dimensiones).

The adaptive behavior of the algorithm make it well suited when the shape of the pattern elicited by the P300 response does not conform to the predicted structure.  This is due to the fact that the descriptors are directly based on how the signals behave in shape domain (i.e. \textit{how actually they looked like}) for the training and calibration step, and they do not require any prior knowledge about the signal.   In contrast, when the shape of the ERP response is not consistent across the same subject, this method would not be able to find the templates and speller performance could be penalized.  

At the same time, by analyzing the generated descriptors, which map in a very detailed and synthetic structure the shape information contained within the patch, a metric about the consistency of the shape of the generated P300 response could also be derived.  It may be worthy of further consideration to evaluate if there is any correlation between the lower performance obtained for some subjects and the characterization of their ALS stage.

We believe that the expanding and the understanding of this tool in order to automatically classify those patterns in EEG that are specifically identified by their shapes (e.g. K-Complex, Vertex Waves, Positive Occipital Sharp Transient \citep{Hartman2005}) is a prospect future work to be considered. We are currently working in unpublished material analyzing KComplex that may also provide  assistance to physician or electroencephalographers to help them locate these EEG patterns particularly in long recording periods, frequent in sleep research.

Moreover, this method can be used as an alternate \textit{BCI predictor} \citep{Clerc}, i.e. to detect BCI illiteracy or to predict the achievable performance of a given method, or even as a tool for artefact removal (which is performed on many occasions by visually inspecting the signal).
