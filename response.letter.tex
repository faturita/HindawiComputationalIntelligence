\section*{\fbox{Reviewer \#1 Transcript:}}

I have read the manuscript "EEG characterization and classification based on Histogram of Gradients of Signal Plots" with great interest since its title promised a solution to an important problem. In spite of presenting an interesting methodology and some interesting issues related to EEG characterization, I consider the manuscript is not ready for publication. 

First of all, the title is misleading since a first, and naive, read suggest being able to classify and characterize any EEG with their different components (i.e., P200, P300, P600, N100, N200, N400 to name a few). Clearly, the title does not match the content since the authors focus on the P300; of course, there is evidence of the benefits of working with these signals, but, is the proposed method extensible to other signals?, this is not clear from the manuscript. 

Another issue with the manuscript is its mathematical vagueness. For example, the variable T is used as a vector or two-tuple but its notation is different from the notation the authors use for vectors. Moreover, there is something wrong in equation (4) and something inconsistent between equations (7) and (8). Also, the authors go back and forth the digital space and the continuous space and although there is an equivalence, the manuscript could benefit from a clearer explanation. 

Another issue that I find worrisome is the design of experiments. First of all, it seems that the number of subjects is rather low, it would be interesting to know why the authors decided to use such a subset. Also, the authors speculate that their results are not that good because they did not take into account the latency and magnitude of the signals, there is previous evidence in the literature that the P300 suffers from these, and other, problems and, thus, one wonders why the authors did not anticipate such problems. 

A couple of finale observations. First, it seems the authors assume that the readers have some previous deep knowledge of some topics such as that some channels should carry more or better information without a previous reference. Another issue has to do with the way the manuscript is written, sometimes is very difficult to follow the ideas the authors want to convey, an example can be found in the paragraph containing equation (5), the manuscript surely benefit from a careful review before submitting.

Thank you very much for your comment.  We published in~\citep{Ramele2016} the application of the same method to identify rhythmic EEG events like Visual Occipital Alpha Waves and to classify Motor Imagery.  We are also working on unpublished material where we are analyzing the same approach for the detection of K-Complexes and classification of  SSVEP patterns but the results are in progress.  We added this information on the article (Introduction and Conclusion, section 3).  We hope this new information enriches the article and clarifies this point.

Thank you for the observation.  We worked hard to improve all the mathematical description of the method. The issue with variable T was fixed and we improved on the font styling to differentiate vectors and scalars.  Section 1.1 was modified as well as section 1.2.3.  The mathematical terminology were corrected all along the article. We hope we have full addressed this point. }

We appreciate a lot your truthful comment.  Equation (4) is very important for us because it is the essence of the method.  %We based that equation on the description of how the histogram of oriented gradients is calculated published in Vedaldi and Szeliski, Computer Vision and Algorithms.  
We reviewed the equation, corrected their terms and we hope it is now more clear.

We have revised the manuscript and modified equations (7) and (8) (now (8) and (9)) which are located on Section 1.2.3 (Parameters).  We added more information on the text and specified subscript indexes to avoid the inconsistency.
We thank you for noticing this.

Thank you for the observation.  We modified all equations to emphasize the point that they are calculated in digital space, particularly on equation (4). We also added that image gradients are also calculated using finite differences, and added information about the support of each equation to explain that they are actually calculated in digital space.
With this, we hope we have full addressed your point.

Thank you for your comment. The original dataset was published as the 008-2014 dataset at the BNCI-Horizon website, which is very important in BCI Research.  As far as we are aware of, experiments on this dataset of ALS patients has not been published by any independent group.
In order to address this issue, we included a new own dataset with the same experimental conditions that we generated ourselves, on healthy subjects.  We published this dataset on the Kaggle platform for replication.

Thank you for your comments.  We added more detailed information that address this issue. First in Section 1.1.4  we included information about the signal averaging procedure.  In Section 1.2.3 we added the parameters that were used.  More importantly, in Section 2 we added information and references about the tests that we did to address latency and amplitude issues.  We included in Section 3 information about future and current works where we are also dealing with these problems.
We hope we full addressed your remarks.

Thank you for your suggestion. The Results section was modified to clarify the expectation about the EEG channels where a visual P300 oddball paradigm generates stronger signals.  We also added references.
We hope we  have addressed your point with this.
